# fooof_on_NeSitA
This project was developed in the scope of my master thesis in Human Factors at TU Berlin. The goal was to predict performance with biophysiological data, namely EEG and event-related data. I [used](https://github.com/EricKolibacz/fooof_on_NeSitA/blob/main/extract_data.m) the data from the [NeSitA](https://blogs.tu-berlin.de/bpn_bemobil/projects/neuroergonomics-of-situation-awareness-nesita/) project, [transformed](https://github.com/EricKolibacz/fooof_on_NeSitA/blob/main/analysis_blocks.m) it into the desired data format via a automated data pipeline, [applied](https://github.com/EricKolibacz/fooof_on_NeSitA/blob/main/analysis_blocks.m) [fooof](https://fooof-tools.github.io/fooof/) to it and extracted relevant information for the following analysis. Results were [plotted](https://github.com/EricKolibacz/fooof_on_NeSitA/blob/main/plotting.m) into meaningful plots. 

The project was never intended to be collaborative, hence the code lacks meaningful variable names, misses some explanatory comments, and was not planed with posterior considerations on a clear software architecture.
